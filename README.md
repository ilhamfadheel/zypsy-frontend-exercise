# Zypsy Frontend Exercise

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your daily work approach. We mostly use React and TypeScript at Zypsy, but you can use any tools you feel most comfortable with.

## Requirements

We want you to develop entirely new view of posts list. Posts are accessible by category. Posts can have many categories.

- When clicking on a category, category's posts are displayed. Selected category should be maintained if user reloads the page in the browser
- When clicking on a star icon, category is marked as favorite
- User can view **All categories** or filter by **Favorite categories**

Approach this task as you would a full-fledged application. Develop a complete feature. Use any libraries or tools you want. We value excellent UX, attention to details, code quality, readability, maintainability and performance. The more skills you show us, the better.

Create your code in `frontend` directory and send us Git repository.

Feel free to ask questions!
